# Binary And Back

The main point of this repo is to just play around with custom formatted binary files and to have a place to save some snippets in the C programming language. This is mostly for fun.

Due to some compilers padding data, we'll be writing each member individually instead of batching it all together and using compiler methods to pack.

This is mostly just chicken scratch.
